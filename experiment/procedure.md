### Procedure

1. Student need to copy the command(“configure terminal”) by single clicking it  and paste in the terminal.

2. Observe entering into the configuration mode of the firewall.

3. Copy the command(“show interface INTERFACE_NAME”) paste in the terminal.

4. Change the “INTERFACE_NAME” to the interface name which is given.

5. Observe the interface information and the IP address of the server.

6. Copy the command(“show interface INTERFACE_NAME”) paste in the terminal and click enter.

7. Observe the access list information of the firewall.

8. Copy the command(“access-list block-packet deny tcp any host SERVER_IP_ADDRESS eq PORT_NUMBER”) paste in the terminal.

9. Change the SERVER_IP_ADDRESS to ip address which you can see after running the second command and PORT_NUMBER to the port number of the tcp packet that you want to block traffic which the student can see on the right side.

10. Press “ENTER’ to observe the simulation.

11. Copy the command(“access-list block-packet allow tcp any host SERVER_IP_ADDRESS eq PORT_NUMBER”) paste in the terminal.

12. Change the SERVER_IP_ADDRESS to ip address which you can see after running the second command and PORT_NUMBER to the port number of the tcp packet that you want to allow traffic which the student can see on the right side.

13. Press “ENTER’ to observe the simulation.

14. Repeat these steps for eight packets.

15. Click “Verify Rules”.

16. If the “correct” rules are written by the student, the simulation will result in a “Well Done” alert box. If the rules are wrongly written, the student is asked to repeat the simulation
