### Theory

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are security devices that monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and prevent those activities from succeeding. IPS works by analyzing network traffic in real-time and looking for known attack patterns, unusual traffic behavior, or other signs of malicious activity. When an attack is detected, the IPS can take action to block or prevent the attack, thus protecting the network and its resources.

One example of an IPS is Cisco's Firepower IPS, which uses a combination of signature-based detection and machine learning techniques to identify and block attacks in real-time. The Firepower IPS can detect and prevent a wide range of network-based attacks, including malware infections, DDoS attacks, and attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities in network devices.

Another example is the Suricata IPS, which is an open-source IPS solution that uses a combination of signature-based detection and anomaly detection techniques to identify and prevent attacks. Suricata can detect and prevent a wide range of network-based attacks, including intrusions, malware infections, and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in network devices.

IPS systems are an essential component of any modern network security infrastructure, as they can help to prevent attacks and protect critical network resources. IPS can be deployed in various network locations, including at the perimeter of the network, in the data center, or on endpoints.

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The firewall is designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network by filtering the traffic that passes through it.

For example, imagine you have a computer network in your office that contains sensitive financial data. To protect this data, you install a firewall at the entrance to your network. The firewall is configured to block any incoming traffic that is not authorized, based on pre-established rules.

You can set up rules in the firewall to allow only specific types of traffic from certain IP addresses or domains. You might allow incoming traffic on port 80 for web browsing, but block traffic on port 25, which is used for email. You can also configure the firewall to block certain types of traffic based on protocols or keywords.

In this scenario, if an attacker attempts to access your network by sending unauthorized traffic, the firewall will detect the intrusion and block the traffic based on its predefined rules. This can help prevent data breaches, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, malware infections, and other types of cyber attacks.

Firewalls can be either hardware-based or software-based, and they can be implemented in a variety of network environments, such as on-premise, cloud, or hybrid infrastructures. Overall, the firewall is an essential component of network security, providing a first line of defense against cyber threats.

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and firewalls are both important network security technologies that work together to protect against various types of cyberattacks.

A firewall can block unauthorized access to the network, prevent malicious traffic from entering the network, and control the types of traffic that are allowed in and out of the network.

An IPS is an advanced security system that goes beyond the basic functions of a firewall to actively monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and prevent those activities from succeeding. IPS can analyze network traffic in real-time, looking for known attack patterns, unusual traffic behavior, or other signs of malicious activity. When an attack is detected, the IPS can take action to block or prevent the attack, thus protecting the network and its resources.

Combining an IPS with a firewall provides a more comprehensive network security solution. The firewall provides a first line of defense, controlling access to the network and blocking unauthorized traffic. The IPS then adds an extra layer of security, detecting and preventing attacks that may bypass the firewall's security measures.

For example, a firewall can be configured to allow traffic only on specific ports and protocols, while the IPS can analyze the traffic on those ports and protocols for signs of malicious activity. If an attack is detected, the IPS can send an alert to the network administrator and take appropriate action to prevent the attack.

Overall, the combination of an IPS and firewall provides a powerful defense against a wide range of cyber threats, ensuring that the network and its resources are protected from both known and unknown attacks
